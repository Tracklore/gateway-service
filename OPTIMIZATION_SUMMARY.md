# Gateway Service Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the optimizations implemented in the Tracklore Gateway Service to minimize resource usage and improve performance.

## 1. Connection Pooling
- **Issue**: The `_proxy_request` function was creating a new `httpx.AsyncClient` for every request, resulting in a new TCP handshake with downstream services for each proxied request
- **Solution**: Implemented a single, global, long-lived `httpx.AsyncClient` instance (`_client`) that is reused across all proxied requests
- **Benefits**: Reduced CPU load, lower latency, and decreased memory churn through TCP connection reuse
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/routes.py`, `app/main.py`

## 2. Dockerfile Optimization
- **Issue**: Inefficient Docker build process with poor layer caching and single-stage build
- **Solution**: 
  - Reordered build steps to copy `requirements.txt` first, allowing dependency installation to be cached
  - Implemented multi-stage build to reduce final image size
- **Benefits**: Faster builds, smaller final image size, and lower deployment time
- **Files Modified**: `Dockerfile`

## 3. Memory Optimization for Large Payloads
- **Issue**: The proxy logic was reading the entire request body into memory as a single bytes object, potentially causing memory exhaustion for large file uploads
- **Solution**: Added support for streaming request bodies directly to downstream services when payload exceeds a threshold (configurable via `settings.max_request_size`)
- **Benefits**: Reduced memory usage for large file transfers and prevention of memory exhaustion
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/routes.py`

## 4. CORS Security and Performance
- **Issue**: Using wildcard `allow_origins=["*"]` for CORS, which is both a security concern and has marginal performance impact
- **Solution**: Replaced wildcard with a specific list of allowed origins configurable via settings
- **Benefits**: Improved security and slight performance gain
- **Files Modified**: `app/main.py`, `shared-libs/core/settings.py`

## 5. Logging Optimization
- **Issue**: Default logging level of INFO in production environments creates unnecessary disk I/O and CPU usage
- **Solution**: Made logging level configurable via environment variable with a default of WARNING for production
- **Benefits**: Reduced disk I/O and CPU time spent on logging in high-traffic environments
- **Files Modified**: `app/main.py`

## 6. Additional Configuration Optimizations
- Added various performance-related settings in `shared-libs/core/settings.py`:
  - `max_connection_pool_size`: Maximum number of connections in the HTTP client pool
  - `max_keepalive_connections`: Maximum number of keep-alive connections
  - `keepalive_expiry`: Expiration time for keep-alive connections
  - `request_timeout`: Timeout for HTTP requests
  - `connect_timeout`: Connection timeout for HTTP requests
  - `max_request_size`: Threshold for switching to streaming mode
  - `allowed_origins`: List of allowed CORS origins

These optimizations collectively reduce CPU, memory, and storage usage while improving the performance and security posture of the gateway service.
