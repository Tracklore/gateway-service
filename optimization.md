Gateway Service Optimization for Resource Minimization
This document outlines key strategies for optimizing the Tracklore Gateway Service to minimize server resource usage (CPU, memory, and storage).

1. Critical Code Optimization: Connection Pooling
The most critical optimization is to introduce connection pooling for downstream HTTP requests using httpx.

Connection Overhead
Issue: The proxy function _proxy_request in app/api/routes.py creates a new httpx.AsyncClient for every request (async with AsyncClient(...)). This forces a new TCP handshake with downstream services for every proxied request, significantly increasing CPU and latency overhead.

Recommendation: Initialize a single, global, long-lived httpx.AsyncClient instance and reuse it across all proxied requests. This allows the client to maintain an internal connection pool, reusing existing TCP connections.

Resource Impact: Reduced CPU load, lower latency, and decreased memory churn.

Conceptual Implementation Change in app/api/routes.py
Instead of creating a new client per request, define a global client outside of the request handler and use it:

Python

# app/api/routes.py

# ... imports ...
from httpx import AsyncClient 
# ... other imports ...

# Global Client for connection pooling
_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT = httpx.Timeout(30.0, connect=10.0)
_client = AsyncClient(timeout=_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT) # <-- INITIALIZED ONCE

# ...

async def _proxy_request(request: Request, service: str, path: str):
    # ... logic to prepare headers/data ...
    
    # Use the global client (_client) instead of creating a new one with 'async with AsyncClient'
    if circuit_breaker:
        response = await circuit_breaker.call(
            _make_downstream_request, _client, request.method, url, headers, data
        )
    else:
        response = await _make_downstream_request(_client, request.method, url, headers, data)
    
    # ... return response ...
2. Dockerfile Optimization (Image Size and Build Time)
To reduce storage, network bandwidth, and deployment time, the Dockerfile should be updated for better layer caching and multi-stage builds.

Layer Caching
Issue: The current Dockerfile copies the entire codebase before installing dependencies (COPY . /app), meaning any code change invalidates the cache for the dependency installation step (pip install).

Optimization: Reorder build steps. Copy only requirements.txt first, run pip install to cache dependencies, and then copy the rest of the application code. This ensures package installation only reruns when requirements.txt changes.

Resource Impact: Faster builds and lower Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) costs.

Image Size
Issue: A single-stage build is used, retaining build artifacts, caches, and development tools required for installation.

Optimization: Implement a multi-stage build. Use a builder stage (with a full Python image) to install dependencies, and a minimal final runtime stage (e.g., python:3.11-slim) that only copies the application code and the necessary installed dependencies.

Resource Impact: Significantly smaller final image, reduced deployment time, and reduced memory usage during image loading.

3. Memory Optimization (Large Payloads)
Issue
The proxy logic reads the entire request body into memory as a single bytes object: data = await request.body(). If the gateway is used for large file uploads, this can lead to the gateway holding multiple copies of the payload in memory, resulting in memory exhaustion.

Recommendations
Implement Request Streaming: For production environments where large file transfers are expected, modify the proxy function to stream the incoming request body directly to the downstream service using an asynchronous iterator. This avoids loading the entire payload into a single in-memory buffer.

Enforce Limits: If streaming is not immediately feasible, enforce a strict Request Size Limit (e.g., via a proxy server like Nginx or Envoy placed in front of the gateway) to prevent excessively large or malicious requests from consuming all available memory.

4. Configuration Refinements
CORS (app/main.py): Replace the wildcard allow_origins=["*"] with an explicit list of domains that will host the frontend application. This is a security best practice that also offers a marginal performance gain by avoiding a more general check.

Logging (General): In a high-traffic production environment, consider adjusting the logging level from INFO (the current default) to a higher level like WARNING or ERROR. This reduces disk I/O and CPU time spent formatting, processing, and writing fewer log messages.
